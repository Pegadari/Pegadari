Hi, Iâ€™m Pegadari

I'm currently working on a few projects with the goal of at least one commit per day.
Sometimes these commits are very minor, but I try to maintain a production level standard. Hopefully, this will increase the speed with which I can write production level code.

See my pinned projects for the ones I'm working on the most.
