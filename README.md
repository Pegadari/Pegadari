Hi, Iâ€™m Pegadari

Here are some projects I'm working on:
  - A Pico Ducky (Raspberry Pi Pico Rubber Ducky)
  - A Flask website hosted on my Raspberry Pi.
  - A neural network to climate control my room. It will use probes both inside and outside my room and be able to open/close windows and blinds - or at least tell me what to do :)
